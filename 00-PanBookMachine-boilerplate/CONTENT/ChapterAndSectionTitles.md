# Chapter and section titles: styles, behaviour, format

## Do not number this section title {-}

If you add `{-}` (curly bracket, dash, curly bracket) at the end of a chapter title or section title, 
it will not be numbered in the toc or the body of the text.

The numbering will also be "stalled", i.e. the number that should go to this title, will go to the next.
